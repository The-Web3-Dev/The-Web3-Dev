Hi ! 
This might sound redundant but I love all things web3, so this is literally the start of my journey. 

I love puzzles so I thing I might be on the right track. Speaking of which I love playing all kinds of instruments. Again, puzzles. 
I might create a travel blog on this web3 journey, since there is a lot to be learn! 

See you all on the other side of the rabbit hole.
